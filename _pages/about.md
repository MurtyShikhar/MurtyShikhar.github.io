I am currently a 5th year CS PhD Student in the Stanford NLP Group, advised by [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/). 

I'm interested in building learning systems that can learn [rich structures](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=sAOOeI878Ns) from limited data, and generalize ([2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12889), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18741)) beyond what they were trained on. These days, I'm thinking a lot about long-horizon planning and reasoning in Language Models.

I interned at Google Deepmind in Summer 2023 where I worked with Mandar Joshi, Kenton Lee and Pete Shaw. In Summer 2021, I interned with Marco Ribeiro and Scott Lundberg at Microsoft Research.
